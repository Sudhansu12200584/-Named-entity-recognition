Named Entity Recognition (NER)
This repository contains the implementation of a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system. NER is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which involves identifying and classifying key information (entities) in text into predefined categories such as names of persons, organizations, locations, dates, and more.
Introduction

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical NLP task widely used in applications like information extraction, question answering, and machine translation. This project provides an end-to-end NER pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

The NER system identifies and classifies entities in text into categories such as:

Person: Names of people (e.g., Albert Einstein, Elon Musk)
Organization: Names of companies, agencies, institutions (e.g., Google, UN)
Location: Geographic entities like cities, countries (e.g., New York, France)
Date: Specific dates, durations, or time expressions (e.g., 2023, two weeks ago)
Other: Custom categories based on the dataset or specific needs.
Features
Pre-trained Models: Easily use pre-trained models such as BERT, spaCy, or NLTK for entity recognition.
Custom Training: Train your own NER model on custom datasets.
Scalable: Extendable to different types of NER tasks with minimal effort.
Evaluation Metrics: Calculate precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
Data Augmentation: Option to enhance training data through augmentation techniques.
